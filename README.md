# Micropay
Micropay, the easiest way to send and receive crypto tokens.

Using Micropay, anyone can deposit and send tokens to another person whether or not they already have a crypto wallet with just a link. The kicker is… the link is a smart contract wallet!

Micropay is a lightweight non custodial wallet designed to make transferring digital assets as easy as sending a link. Someone with crypto can create a Micropay and send that link to anyone over any platform (text, discord, email, etc). The amazing thing is, the link is the smart contract wallet!

### How it Works
1. Create a Micropay Link
2. Share your Micropay Link
3. Claim Reward

Micropay trying to represent the idea of 'Digital Cash' better than any other cryptocurrency, asset or tool on the market today

### Inspiration
*There's still a tremendous amount of friction in crypto that holds back mainstream adoption. It's unreasonable to ask the general population to set up a 12- or 24-word seed phrase wallet, much less a hardware wallet, just to send a dollar or receive a commemorative NFT.*
